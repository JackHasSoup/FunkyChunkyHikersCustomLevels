# FunkyChunkyHikersCustomLevels
The starter kit for creating a custom FCH level!


So you want to create a FCH level do you?

Currently this functionality is limited to Dev Builds and so only dev testers can do this.



Step 1.

Create a new empty 2D unity project 
downlaod the zip file in this repo and extract it into the assets folder of your project
Also make a folder in your assets folder called "AssetBundles" (without the quotes)

Step 2. 

Time to build the level! in the included unity scene there are 2 spawn points, you can move these around (just remember that the hikers have a rope boundry that they must spawn within)

FCH uses the tilemap system but you can use whatever you want to build the level, custom scripts are not supported though.

Make sure to mark all art assets you used to be included in the asset bundle build

Step 3. 

Time to build!
At the top of the window you'll see a dropdown called FCH, click it then select the apropriate option from its options.

Once it builds succesfully you'll find it in that "AssetBundles" folder you made earlier (in your file manager, unity does not show this file)

Step 4.

To load your new map, open FCH, go to info, then Levels, and enter the path to your level in the text box and click Go
